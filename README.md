# Triangle-challenge

The attached project, according to the requirements, takes the length of 3 sides of the triangle from user and determine its type. To do this, it uses functions that retrieve input values from the user and pass them out after validating them and preventing incorrect inputs and errors in the program. These functions are called in the main function. Then every 3 values are displayed to the user. And now it's time to calculate the type of triangle. The values received from the user are passed to this function. In this function, the possibility of forming a triangle with input numbers is checked, and then the type of triangle is detected according to the mathematical rules and the response is returned. The process of receiving numbers and determine the type of triangle continues until the user enters the end condition. Error Handling is also accomplished through Try&Catch and Validation.
